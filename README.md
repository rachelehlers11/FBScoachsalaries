NCAA Football Coach Salaries scraped from USA Today (FBS only)

Every year USA Today Sports requests financial information from public NCAA institutions. This includes the salaries for FBS coaches.  Data is published at the following links:  

Head coaches: http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/ 
Assistant coaches: http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/football/assistant 
Strength coaches: http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/football/strength 

Data is currently available at those links for 2017 for head coaches and 2016 for assistants. I scraped those tables using the requests library. In 2016, assistants and strength coaches were separated. To get data from the other years USA Today had published, 2014 and 2015, I used the WayBack Machine and scraped the same table. 



Each year, there are a few anomalies in the data, and they're explained at the following links:
