    "## Scraping the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2014, USA Today has requested FBS football coach compensation data from all 128 FBS schools. Each year, they update their salary data pages, in \"data links\" below. The catch here was that USA Today doesn't keep the past years' data live on their website, and there was no easily accessible archive (easily accessible means on the first couple pages of Google). Luckily, the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/) contains archives of the USA Today salary data. If you haven't ever used the Wayback Machine, I encourage you to check it out. To get the old versions of the data, I simply copied and pasted the appropriate links into the Wayback machine, then accessed the page matching that year's assistant coach methodology publish date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methodologies for gathering compensation data, notes about abnormal data, and  the explanations for each type of compensation received, can be found at the \"methodology links\" below. \n",
